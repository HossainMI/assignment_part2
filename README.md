# Assignment part 2
This assignment is a part of the selection process for the 'Data Scientist' position at Renata Limited. This repository contains the code and resources for my data science projects

This repository contains three separate code files:

"Assignment Part 2 (xlsx to CSV).ipynb" is used to convert an Excel data file from XLSX format to CSV format.
"Assignment Part 2 (Encoding and Clustering).ipynb" is used for data encoding and clustering tasks.
"Additional work (Hierarchical Clustering).ipynb" is an additional piece of work that applies hierarchical clustering with a dendrogram.

Each code file serves a specific purpose and contributes to the overall analysis and exploration of the data.
