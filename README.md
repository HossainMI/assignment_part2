# Assignment part 2
This assignment is a part of the selection process for the 'Data Scientist' position at Renata Limited. This repository contains the code and resources for my data science projects

This repository contains three separate code files:

"Assignment Part 2 (xlsx to CSV).ipynb" is used to convert an Excel data file from XLSX format to CSV format.
"Assignment Part 2 (Encoding and Clustering).ipynb" is used for data encoding and clustering tasks.
"Additional work (Hierarchical Clustering).ipynb" is an additional piece of work that applies hierarchical clustering with a dendrogram.

Each code file serves a specific purpose and contributes to the overall analysis and exploration of the data.

This repository showcases a collection of Python scripts developed using Python version 3.11.4. The scripts utilize several essential packages, including:

- "os": The "os" package is used to manipulate and set the working directory, allowing for easy navigation and access to files.

- "pandas": This package is employed to import Excel and CSV files as dataframes, enabling efficient data manipulation and analysis.

- "openpyxl": The "openpyxl" package is specifically used for handling Excel files, facilitating seamless interaction with XLSX data.

- "scikit-learn": This powerful package is utilized for various machine learning tasks. In this repository, it is primarily employed for implementing the K-means clustering algorithm.

- "matplotlib": This package is essential for generating visually appealing plots and graphs, making it suitable for data visualization purposes.

- "scipy": The "scipy" package is utilized to access the "dendrogram" function, which enables the creation of dendrograms for hierarchical clustering analysis.

These scripts provide a comprehensive demonstration of utilizing these packages for data preprocessing, clustering, and visualization tasks.
